JavaScript & Bootstrap Usage:
I used Bootstrap 5 for the responsive grid system (rows/cols) and the Navbar component. I used JavaScript to create a full-screen loading animation that fades out upon page load, and to create an event listener on the contact form that triggers an alert instead of refreshing the page.
