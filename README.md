## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It serves as a digital home to display my projects in C, Python, and Web Development, as well as my background in Operating Systems and 3D Art.

The design focuses on a modern **"Dark Mode" aesthetic** (Deep Charcoal & Electric Teal), utilizing a floating card layout that stands out from standard full-width websites.
