# CS50 Problem Set 8 - Homepage

This repository contains my solution for the "Homepage" problem from Harvard's CS50 course. The project involves creating a comprehensive, multipage personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap 5 framework.

## Files

`index.html` : The landing page containing the "Hero" section, introduction, and navigation to other areas of the site.

`projects.html` : A gallery page displaying my work in C, Python, and UI Design using responsive Bootstrap cards.

`about.html` : A personal page detailing my background, including interests in Operating Systems, 3D Animation, and Coding.

`contact.html` : A functional interface allowing users to send messages via a simulated form and view social media links.

`styles.css` : The custom stylesheet that overrides Bootstrap defaults to create the "Dark/Teal" theme, floating card layout, and animations.

## Description

The website is designed with a unified "Dark Mode" aesthetic (Deep Charcoal & Electric Teal) and demonstrates mastery of grid layouts and responsive design:

- **Global Navigation:**
  - A consistent Bootstrap Navbar is present on all pages.
  - Features a custom FontAwesome hamburger menu for mobile devices.
  - The "Active" state highlights the current page link in Electric Teal.

- **Responsive Layout:**
  - **Desktop:** The content "floats" in the center of the screen with a 50px margin, creating a modern card effect.
